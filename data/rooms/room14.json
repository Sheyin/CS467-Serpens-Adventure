Studies have shown that relatively high doses were needed for some people, and that additional medications such as benzodiazepines were added to counteract some of the side effects.  Subjects without the additives showed excessive anxiety and were prone to seizures.  The subjects with them have been functional and show signs of enhanced intelligence and spontaneous creativity/insights but seem prone to develop a dissociative fugue...",

Alpha group did not respond at all to the treatment, but after incrementing the dosage to nearly ten times the original amount, the subjects became far more passive and tractable.  However, they seemed unable to retain new memories and were prone to heightened anxiety and seizures.  Subjects seemed to develop a cognative dissonance, nearing apathy, where information concerning their own situation was concerned.  It seems that these subjects are functional but seem no longer seem to be aware, or do not care, that they are participating in an experiment, even when told so.",

After the failure of the alpha group, subject group beta was administered a similar amount of medication along with benzodiazepines, opioid analgesics, dopamine agonists and antihistimines.  The resulting treatment proved effective in creating mostly tractable subjects but their recollection was severely impacted, as well as inexplicably causing severe incontinence and diarrhea.  Moderating the mixture may be necessary to reduce adverse side effects.  This mixture has shown to be useful as the information gained during the test seems to be lost as the treatment wears off, allowing for re-use of the subjects after a period of detoxification and restoration to baseline physical health levels.",

Individualized tests have become necessary in order to study the efficacy of different quantities of each component.  It is our belief that by putting the subject in an optimal situation to follow through with a suggestion, then they will carry through and allow us to observe their actions in a much more natural setting.  The treatment seems to wear off after about two weeks, allowing us to retrieve the given subject and run the experiment again.",
