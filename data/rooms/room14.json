It was the only way to pay for our boy's medical bills.  I'm scared at being away from you both for so long, and I don't even know when I'll be able to go home.  But I'm much more terrified of losing him forever.  They say that they'll pay the bills in full and give him the best treatment they can, if I participate in this experiment.  I hope I'll see you again soon.  They'll send this letter for me while I'm doing this.  Much love to you both.'",
